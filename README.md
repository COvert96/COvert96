## Hey there!  <img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/v1.Y2lkPTc5MGI3NjExa252YWJyNTAxaGU5MGEwNjM4Nmc5eTl0NTJiMDVxamZhZXVsd2RxbiZlcD12MV9zdGlja2Vyc19zZWFyY2gmY3Q9ZQ/LOnt6uqjD9OexmQJRB/giphy.gif" width="36">

I'm Chris, currently working on an MSc in **Control & Simulation** at TU Delft and moonlighting as an **AI Engineer** at **MSF (Doctors Without Borders)**.

## About Me  <img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/HrRvnN7NuJy4InG4MV/giphy.gif?cid=790b7611aihcpm34y4dcrvfzyk6h8qzy6bgvvnbxphj0umpd&ep=v1_stickers_search&rid=giphy.gif&ct=s" width="26">

- **Print-On-Demand (ex-)Entrepreneur**: I co-founded and ran a B2B print-on-demand startup with my brother for 2.5 years. We built a platform from scratch with a team of devs using **Next.js**, **Bamboo**, and **AWS**‚Äîa wild ride that taught me to juggle code, coffee, and clients like a pro.
- **First Neural Net & Beyond**: My very first neural net (Python, 2017) got accepted at the **ATRS World Conference**, and I‚Äôve been addicted to AI ever since. 
- **Fun AI Projects**: 
  - An **AI driving bot for GTA**‚Äîunfortunately I didn't tell it that it was playing GTA, so it was far too civilised.
  - A **YOLO model for RuneScape farming**‚Äîdigital agriculture meets object detection.
  - A **Tic-Tac-Toe bot** using minimax with alpha-beta pruning‚Äîyes, it still gloats when it wins.
- **Algorithmic Pairs Trading** with RandomForest regression using sklearn, interactive brokers, and a ton of (paper) money. Sorry the repo is private ü§´
- **Learning the Azure Cloud**: At MSF, I'm diving deep into **Azure** services and exploring how AI can make a real difference in humanitarian missions.

## Current Focus  <img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/v1.Y2lkPTc5MGI3NjExMThlY2dxd2p4MW4ydmY4NnVzbzdqY2UwN2x5ZjI0YWFicG1rcDNxNyZlcD12MV9zdGlja2Vyc19zZWFyY2gmY3Q9cw/QZVdubDMj6RCvBOQBk/giphy.gif" width="42">

- **Advanced Control & Simulation**: Perfecting my knowledge of aerospace, robotics, and how to make systems do what they‚Äôre told.
- **Cloud AI**: Leveraging Azure to deploy, scale, and maintain ML solutions that (hopefully) save lives and make the world a tad better.
- **Casual Game Dev**: Because occasionally you just want to blow things up (virtually, of course)
